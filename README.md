# thunk-operating-system
I can write what I want to be the case. Thank you for installing thunk-operating-system. This is an imaginary desktop environment and computer environment.

 This is documentation for how things work.

Thunk operating system and desktop environment is:

* asynchronous driven, evented
* parallel
* data flow orientated
* queued
* scroll based
* chainable

An operating system desktop that is commanded by [GUI thunking](https://github.com/samsquire/gui-thunks) and state machine formulation.

# Thunks are the primitive of this desktop

Thunks are like autocomplete options in a program that you can browse into without cost of execution to see how things look if you were to do it.

Whereas other traditional operating systems desktops such as in Windows, Linux, Mac have the primitives of Menus, Windows, Icons. The primitive of thunk-operating-system and desktop is the **thunk**. Thunks are hyperlinks into possible arrangements.

A thunk has a type and a number of operations that can be done on it. We can navigate through thunks without computation but we know what the shape of the thunk shall be based on any operation on it.

We can therefore create something that "looks right" by simple navigation.



# Structured interaction programming

| Table of thunk operations | Description                   |
| ------------------------- | ----------------------------- |
| fact(parameter)           | Associate parameter with fact |
|                           |                               |



# Thunks can be moved around



# 1. Scalable architecture is sliced into threads

```

thread(1) iothread(1) send-thread = setup-send-connections | liburing_wait | dispatch_to_thread
thread(2) iothread(2) recv-thread = setup-recv-connections | liburing_wait | dispatch_to_thread
dispatch_to_thread thread(X) = parse-request | update-database | queue-broadcast

```

a global stack for my function, global variables, are they really global?

memory management between threads, closures

the essence of the problem, everything else is just logistics

make this look like that, draw diagram, can it be verified?

# 2. Visual basic for thunks

# 3. Standard data binding and layout arrangement algorithms

Draw diagrams with rectangles, layout items to rectangles automatically, allocate, or generate grid, transpose

Visual arrangements, timelines.

Just arrange colours to coloured buckets

Coloured Plots.

Interaction intersection is a program that decides what to do via plotting, moving between locations. Either raise new events that need to be plotted, handled, or reconciled. (Side by side behaviour by default) meet in the middle
